# TODO
- [X] Fix when inf numbers are written as final results in the result table. (It raises an error when rounding the value)
- [X] When a row is selected in the session, but it does not exit, the app crash until we reset the cookies in the GUI. Fix this
- [X] Add a way to disable the result socket. (You can call the methods, but it does nothing) Useful when optimizing with optuna
- [X] Add an option to display chart with a log scale in the GUI
- [X] When a tab has nothing (image, plot, text, scalars, etc), it should not be displayed in the GUI
- [X] Add cli command used to launch the script
- [ ] Log images and matplotlib plots
  - [X] Image support in result Table
  - [X] Image tab in right panel
  - [X] Autolog matplotlib plots in the result table
  - [ ] Fig tab in right panel
- [ ] Log text and html fragments
- [ ] Possibility to install only ResultTable and no GUI (because cannot install fast-html when python has no GIL)
